2) HERO
- H1: Turn your product data into brand-safe images and videos—at scale, without code
- Subhead: Import Excel/CSV, set simple if-else rules, and generate thousands of localized assets in minutes. Update instantly when prices or assortments change.
- Primary CTA: “Apply for Pilot” (prominent, high-contrast)
- Secondary CTA (text link or button): “Watch 2‑minute demo”
- Visual: Static or looped animation showing:
  - Data table → logic nodes → grid of generated assets (images + video thumbnails)

  - Excel/CSV import; regional pricing and localization
  - Brand-locked templates; compliance-ready text blocks
  - Batch images and videos for social, marketplaces, in-store
  - Regenerate everything in minutes when data changes

3) MICRO SOCIAL PROOF

  - “Built with insights from retail leaders”
  - “Designed for promo-heavy retailers and e-commerce teams”
  - Optional expert quote (anonymized if needed): “If one person can handle a full promo cycle in minutes, that’s a game-changer.”

4) PERSONA WINS (ROLE-BASED CARDS)
- 3–4 micro-cards with headline + one sentence each:
  - Marketing: Launch promos faster, react to price changes instantly, keep every channel aligned.
  - Creative/Design: Automate repetitive variants with brand-locked templates; focus on high-impact work.
  - Merchandising: Reflect negotiated deals by region or category with one data import.
  - Ad Ops/Performance: Generate platform-ready variants for testing without waiting on production.

5) PROBLEM SECTION
- H2: Manual production can’t keep up with modern promo cycles
- Bullets:
  - Frequent price and assortment changes across regions and channels
  - Manual tools don’t scale to hundreds or thousands of variants
  - Custom-coded pipelines require engineers and slow iteration
  - Brand inconsistencies and compliance risks under deadline pressure
  - Rising labor costs and omnichannel demands
- Closing line: Teams need a logic-first engine that connects data to creative—fast, consistent, and non-technical.

6) HOW IT WORKS (5-STEP VISUAL)
- H2: How Variota works
- Steps (each with 1–2 sentences):
  1) Import data: Upload Excel/CSV or connect a sheet. Map fields like price, discount, region, category, color, size, and image URLs.
  2) Build logic: Use a no-code, node-based builder to define rules (e.g., “If discount ≥ 50% → red badge + highlight animation”).
  3) Choose templates: Start from brand-locked templates with dynamic fields and platform presets.
  4) Generate at scale: Produce images and videos for all SKUs, regions, and channels in a single run.
  5) Review and publish: Preview variants, route for approval, export or deliver to your channels. Regenerate instantly when data changes.
- CTA beneath steps: “See it in a 2‑minute demo”

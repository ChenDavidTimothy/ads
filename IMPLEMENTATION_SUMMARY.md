---

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 1. Configuration Changes

**File:** `src/server/storage/config.ts`

**Changes Made:**

- Changed `TEMP_DIR_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS` from 1 hour to 3 minutes
- Changed `MAX_TEMP_FILE_AGE_MS` from 1 hour to 3 minutes
- Added comments indicating these are testing values

**Purpose:** Enable rapid testing of cleanup functionality with 3-minute intervals

### 2. SmartStorageProvider Enhancements

**File:** `src/server/storage/smart-storage-provider.ts`

**Changes Made:**

- **Modified `startCleanupInterval()`** method to call comprehensive cleanup
- **Added `performComprehensiveCleanup()`** method for orchestration
- **Added `cleanupOrphanedSupabaseFiles()`** method for storage cleanup
- **Added `cleanupOrphanedRenderJobs()`** method for database cleanup
- **Added `parseStorageUrl()`** method for URL parsing

**New Methods Added:**

```typescript
// Core orchestration method
private async performComprehensiveCleanup(): Promise<void>

// Storage cleanup for orphaned files
private async cleanupOrphanedSupabaseFiles(): Promise<void>

// Database cleanup for orphaned records
private async cleanupOrphanedRenderJobs(): Promise<void>

// URL parsing utility
private parseStorageUrl(url: string): { bucket: string; path: string } | null
```

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Cleanup Flow

```
startCleanupInterval()
    ↓
performComprehensiveCleanup()
    ↓
├── cleanupOldTempFiles()     (existing - local files)
├── cleanupOrphanedSupabaseFiles() (new - storage files)
└── cleanupOrphanedRenderJobs()    (new - database records)
```

### Data Flow

1. **Identify Orphaned Jobs**: Query `render_jobs` for completed jobs older than 3 minutes
2. **Filter Saved Assets**: Query `user_assets` for saved render job references
3. **Calculate Orphaned Files**: Jobs not saved to assets = orphaned
4. **Clean Storage**: Delete orphaned files from Supabase storage
5. **Clean Database**: Delete orphaned render job records

### Safety Mechanisms

- **Age Filtering**: Only deletes files/records older than 3 minutes
- **Asset Protection**: Never deletes files that have been saved to assets
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- **Logging**: Full audit trail for all cleanup operations

---

## TESTING VALIDATION

### Immediate Testing (First 30 minutes)

1. **Deploy changes** to development environment
2. **Generate 3-4 test renders** (do NOT save to assets)
3. **Wait 4 minutes** for cleanup cycle
4. **Verify cleanup logs** appear in console
5. **Run validation queries** to confirm cleanup

### Validation Queries

```sql
-- Check orphaned files count (should be 0 after cleanup)
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_files_count
FROM render_jobs rj
LEFT JOIN user_assets ua ON ua.metadata->>'render_job_id' = rj.id::text
WHERE rj.status = 'completed'
  AND rj.output_url IS NOT NULL
  AND ua.id IS NULL
  AND rj.created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '4 minutes';
```

### Expected Log Output

```
✅ "Starting comprehensive cleanup cycle"
✅ "Cleaning up X orphaned Supabase files"
✅ "Successfully deleted X orphaned files"
✅ "Successfully deleted X orphaned render job records"
✅ "Comprehensive cleanup cycle completed"
```

## PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **Testing completed successfully** in development
- [ ] **All validation queries pass** without errors
- [ ] **No errors in cleanup logs** during testing
- [ ] **Database backup** completed
- [ ] **Low-traffic deployment window** identified
- [ ] **Operations team notified** of deployment

### Deployment Process

1. **Deploy during low-traffic period**
2. **Monitor logs immediately** after deployment
3. **Verify first cleanup cycle** runs successfully
4. **Run validation queries** after first cleanup
5. **Monitor for 30 minutes** to ensure stability

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

- **First 30 minutes**: Monitor every cleanup cycle
- **First 24 hours**: Run validation queries every 2 hours
- **First week**: Daily validation and performance monitoring

---

## PRODUCTION SETTINGS REVERT

### After Testing Validation (1-2 days)

**Update `src/server/storage/config.ts` back to production values:**

```typescript
// Cleanup configuration - PRODUCTION SETTINGS
TEMP_DIR_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
MAX_TEMP_FILE_AGE_MS: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
```

**Benefits of Production Settings:**

- Cleanup runs every hour instead of every 3 minutes
- Files older than 1 hour are cleaned up
- Reduced system overhead while maintaining effectiveness
- Same cleanup effectiveness with longer intervals

---

## MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE

### Daily Monitoring

- Check cleanup logs for errors
- Monitor storage usage trends
- Verify cleanup cycles running
- Check for orphaned files

### Weekly Monitoring

- Run health check queries
- Review storage cost trends
- Check database performance
- Verify saved asset integrity

### Monthly Monitoring

- Comprehensive system review
- Storage usage analysis
- Performance metrics review
- Cost optimization review

---

## EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### Critical Issues

1. **Cleanup System Down**: Check logs, verify configuration, restart if needed
2. **Files Not Deleting**: Check permissions, verify URL parsing, test manually
3. **Database Errors**: Check connectivity, verify table structure, test queries
4. **Saved Assets Affected**: Immediate rollback, investigate root cause

### Rollback Procedures

1. **Complete Rollback**: Revert all changes, restore original functionality
2. **Partial Rollback**: Disable specific failing components
3. **Emergency Cleanup**: Manual cleanup procedures if automated system fails

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Immediate Success (First Week)

- [ ] Cleanup cycles run every 3 minutes without errors
- [ ] Orphaned files reduced from current accumulation to near-zero
- [ ] No saved assets accidentally deleted
- [ ] Storage usage growth rate decreases

### Long-term Success (First Month)

- [ ] Storage costs stabilized/reduced
- [ ] Database performance maintained
- [ ] Zero manual cleanup interventions needed
- [ ] User workflow unaffected

---

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Performance Characteristics

- **Cleanup Frequency**: Every 3 minutes (testing), every hour (production)
- **File Age Threshold**: 3 minutes (testing), 1 hour (production)

- **Database Load**: Light - efficient queries with proper indexing

### Safety Features

- **Age Protection**: Never deletes files younger than threshold
- **Asset Protection**: Never deletes saved assets
- **Error Isolation**: Failures don't stop the cleanup interval
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial failures don't break the system

### Monitoring Capabilities
